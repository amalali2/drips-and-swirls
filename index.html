        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <p>
            Weâ€™re all about our soft serve & coffee.
            With our soft serve, we promise no fillers, no binders, no dairy powders, and absolutely no gimmicks. Everything is made from scratch, 100% real dairy, and done with a chefâ€™s twist. For us, itâ€™s never about how many cookies, candy bars, or sprinkles you can put on it, itâ€™s all about the soft serve.
            With our our coffee, the purveyors that we receive our coffee beans from care about their product as much as we do about serving it. Every cup whether itâ€™s hot or cold, will be served, steeped, and brewed with attention to flavor & detail.  Coffee lovers know that selecting the right beans are important to the taste, but so is the way you brew it. We are always about doing it the right way, every day, every time, and we want you to taste the difference.
